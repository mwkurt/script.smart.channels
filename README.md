# script.smart.channels
This is a script that will create m3u playlist (channel) from Kodi's Smart Playlist(s). It creates the m3u episodes in a specific fasion to
where the channels require no human intervention after the channel is created. The channels will regenerate themselves and theoretically
play forever, recycling tv show episodes after the last episode is played. The script will, when run, display the channels in a dialog with the ability to select an episode and start playback using Kodi's video playback system. Channels will have specific channel rules to adhere to for m3u creation and playback.
